## Notes
At this moment, several stuff have been implemented, such as Rest API, early implementation of channels new look and feel (codenamed as Nouveau), rewritten converter of videos and more. Also the repurposal of project is marked, in order to make it more consistent and faster, in plan of workarounds and support of extending source code. Legacy components are still left, like AJAX modules and more, but they're slowly getting ported into newer API system, to make VidLii's security holes even less.

Feel free to fork this repo and/or make commits there!
